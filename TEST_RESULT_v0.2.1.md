# Test Result — Luke Shop Platform Admin v0.2.1

- Source safety/regression: **40/40 PASS**
- Professional design regression: **6/6 PASS**
- TypeScript transpile syntax gate: **14 JS/JSX source files PASS**
- Backend/database contract: unchanged; Backend v0.8.0 + migrations through 009 remain authoritative.
- Dependency-backed Vite build in packaging environment: **not claimed** because an offline npm install could not resolve `@vitejs/plugin-react` from cache. Run `npm run build` on Windows after dependencies are installed.
